How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

cd ~                          # change directories to your home directory
mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called lesson_1_reflections.txt (you can replace subl with another editor here if you prefer a different one)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
